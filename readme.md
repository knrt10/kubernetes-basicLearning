This is just a simple demonstration to get a basic understanding of how kubernetes works while working step by step. I learnt kubernetes like this and made this repo to solve some problems that I faced during my learning experience so that it might help other beginners. We won't be going into depth about docker :blush: but will see sufficient content to get you basic understanding to learn and work with kuberntes. :v: Hope you enjoy learning. If you like it please give it a :star2:. 

**Important :-** By seeing size of readme you might have second thoughts but to be honest if you work from start you won't experience any problem and learn along the way.

## Requirements

- You need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed for your OS
- [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) installed for running locally
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed.

## Simple concepts before we start

#### What is docker

Docker is a platform for packaging, distribution and running applications. It allows you to package your application together with its whole environment. This can be either a few libraries that the app requires or even all the files that are usually available on the filesystem of an installed operating system. Docker makes it possible to transfer this package to a central repository from which it can then be transferred to any computer running Docker and executed there

Three main concepts in Docker comprise this scenario:
- **Images** :— A Docker based container image is something you package your application and its environment into. It contains the filesystem that will be available to the application and other metadata, such as the path to the executable that should be executed when the image is run.
- **Registries** :- A Docker Registry is a repository that stores your Docker images and facilitates easy sharing of those images between different people and computers. When you build your image, you can either run it on the computer you’ve built it on, or you can push (upload) the image to a registry and then pull (download) it on another computer and run it there. Certain registries are public, allowing anyone to pull images from it, while others are private, only accessible to certain people or machines.
- **Containers** :- A Docker-based container is a regular Linux container created from a Docker-based container image. A running container is a process running on the host running Docker, but it’s completely isolated from both the host and all other processes running on it. The process is also resource-constrained, meaning it can only access and use the number of resources (CPU, RAM, and so on) that are allocated to it.

## Learning while working

#### Creating a web server

You first need to create a container image. We will use docker for that. We are creating a simple web server to see how kubernetes works.

- create a file `app.js` and copy this code into it

```js
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');
console.log("Kubia server starting...");
var handler = function (request, response) {
  console.log("Received request from " + request.connection.remoteAddress);
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end("You've hit " + os.hostname() + "\n");
};
var www = http.createServer(handler);
www.listen(8080);

```

Now we will create a docker file that will run on a cluster when we create a docker image. 

- create a file named `Dockerfile` and copy this code into it.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:8 

RUN npm i

ADD app.js /app.js

ENTRYPOINT [ "node", "app.js" ]

```

#### Building docker image

Make sure your **docker server is up and running**. Now we will create a docker image in our local machine. Open your terminal in the current project's folder and run

`docker build -t kubia .`

You’re telling Docker to build an image called **kubia** based on the contents of the current directory (note the dot at the end of the build command). Docker will look for the Dockerfile in the directory and build the image based on the instructions in the file.

Now check your docker image created by running

#### Getting docker images

`docker images`

This command lists all the images.

#### Running the container image

`docker run --name kubia-container -p 8080:8080 -d kubia`

This tells Docker to run a new container called **kubia-container** from the kubia image. The container will be detached from the console (-d flag), which means it will run in the background. Port 8080 on the local machine will be mapped to port 8080 inside the container (-p 8080:8080 option), so you can access the app through [localhost](http://localhost:8080).

#### Accessing your application

Run in your terminal

`curl localhost:8080`
> You’ve hit 44d76963e8e1

#### Listing all your running containers

You can list all your running containers by this command.

`docker ps`

The `docker ps` command only shows the most basic information about the containers.

Also to get additional information about a container run this command

`docker inspect kubia-container`

You can see all the container by

`docker ps -a`

### Running a shell inside an existing container

The Node.js image on which you’ve based your image contains the bash shell, so you can run the shell inside the container like this:

`docker exec -it kubia-container bash`

This will run bash inside the existing **kubia-container** container. The **bash** process will have the same Linux namespaces as the main container process. This allows you to explore the container from within and see how Node.js and your app see the system when running inside the container. The **-it** option is shorthand for two options:

- -i, which makes sure STDIN is kept open. You need this for entering commands into the shell.
- -t, which allocates a pseudo terminal (TTY).

#### Exploring container from within

Let’s see how to use the shell in the following listing to see the processes running in the container.

```bash
root@c61b9b509f9a:/# ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.4  1.3 872872 27832 ?        Ssl  06:01   0:00 node app.js
root        11  0.1  0.1  20244  3016 pts/0    Ss   06:02   0:00 bash
root        16  0.0  0.0  17504  2036 pts/0    R+   06:02   0:00 ps aux
```

You see only three processes. You don’t see any other processes from the host OS.


Like having an isolated process tree, each container also has an isolated filesystem. Listing the contents of the root directory inside the container will only show the files in the container and will include all the files that are in the image plus any files that are created while the container is running (log files and similar), as shown in the following listing.

```bash
root@c61b9b509f9a:/# ls
app.js  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  package-lock.json  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

It contains the **app.js** file and other system directories that are part of the node:8 base image you’re using. To exit the container, you exit the shell by running the **exit** command and you’ll be returned to your host machine (like logging out of an ssh session, for example).

#### Stopping and removing a container

`docker stop kubia-container`

This will stop the main process running in the container and consequently stop the container because no other processes are running inside the container. The container itself still exists and you can see it with **docker ps -a**. The -a option prints out all the containers, those running and those that have been stopped. To truly remove a container, you need to remove it with the **docker rm** command:

`docker rm kubia-container`

This deletes the container. All its contents are removed and it can’t be started again.

### Pushing the image to an image registry

The image you’ve built has so far only been available on your local machine. To allow you to run it on any other machine, you need to push the image to an external image registry. For the sake of simplicity, you won’t set up a private image registry and will instead push the image to [Docker Hub](http://hub.docker.com)

Before you do that, you need to re-tag your image according to Docker Hub’s rules. Docker Hub will allow you to push an image if the image’s repository name starts with your Docker Hub ID. You create your Docker Hub ID by registering at [hub-docker](http://hub.docker.com). I’ll use my own ID (knrt10) in the following examples. Please change every occurrence with your own ID.

Once you know your ID, you’re ready to rename your image, currently tagged as kubia, to knrt10/kubia (replace knrt10 with your own Docker Hub ID):

`docker tag kubia knrt10/kubia`

This doesn’t rename the tag; it creates an additional tag for the same image. You can confirm this by listing the images stored on your system with the docker images command, as shown in the following listing.

`docker images | head`

As you can see, both kubia and knrt10/kubia point to the same image ID, so they’re in fact one single image with two tags.

#### Pushing image to docker hub

Before you can push the image to Docker Hub, you need to log in under your user ID with the **docker login** command. Once you’re logged in, you can finally push the yourid/kubia image to Docker Hub like this:

`docker push knrt10/kubia`

## Working with Kubernetes

Now that you have your app packaged inside a container image and made available through Docker Hub, you can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster instead of running it in Docker directly. But first, you need to set up the cluster itself.

#### Setting up a Kubernetes cluster

Setting up a full-fledged, multi-node Kubernetes cluster isn’t a simple task, especially if you’re not well-versed in Linux and networking administration. A proper Kubernetes install spans multiple physical or virtual machines and requires the networking to be set up properly so that all the containers running inside the Kubernetes cluster can connect to each other through the same flat networking space.

### Running a local single node Kubernetes cluster with Minikube

The simplest and quickest path to a fully functioning Kubernetes cluster is by using Minikube. Minikube is a tool that sets up a single-node cluster that’s great for both testing Kubernetes and developing apps locally.

#### Starting a Kubernetes cluster with minikube

Once you have Minikube installed locally, you can immediately start up the Kubernetes cluster with the command in the following listing.

`minikube start`
```bash
Starting local Kubernetes cluster...
Starting VM...
SSH-ing files into VM...
...
Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.
```

Starting the cluster takes more than a minute, so don’t interrupt the command before
it completes.

#### Checking to see if the cluster is up and kubernetes can talk to it

To interact with Kubernetes, you also need the **kubectl** CLI client. [Installing](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) it is easy.

To verify your cluster is working, you can use the **kubectl cluster-info** command shown in the following listing.

`kubectl cluster-info`
```bash
Kubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443

kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443/api/v1/...

KubeDNS is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

This shows the cluster is up. It shows the URLs of the various Kubernetes components, including the API server and the web console.

#### Deploying your Node app

The simplest way to deploy your app is to use the **kubectl run** command, which will create all the necessary components without having to deal with JSON or YAML.

`kubectl run kubia --image=knrt10/kubia --port=8080 --generator=run/v1`

The --image=knrt10/kubia part obviously specifies the container image you want to run, and the --port=8080 option tells Kubernetes that your app is listening on port 8080. The last flag (--generator) does require an explanation, though. Usually, you won’t use it, but you’re using it here so Kubernetes creates a **ReplicationController** instead of a Deployment.

#### Listing Pods

Because you can’t list individual containers since they’re not standalone Kubernetes objects, can you list pods instead? Yes, you can. Let’s see how to tell kubectl to list pods in the following listing.

`kubectl get pods`

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubia-5k788   1/1       Running   1          7d
```

### Accessing your web application

With your pod running, how do you access it? Each pod gets its own IP address, but this address is internal to the cluster and isn’t accessible from outside of it. To make the pod accessible from the outside, you’ll expose it through a Service object. You’ll create a special service of type LoadBalancer because if you create a regular service (a ClusterIP service), as the pod, it would also only be accessible from inside the cluster. By creating a LoadBalancer-type service, an external load balancer will be created and you can connect to the pod through the load balancer’s public IP.

#### Creating a service object

To create the service, you’ll tell Kubernetes to expose the ReplicationController you created earlier:

`kubectl expose rc kubia --type=LoadBalancer --name kubia-http`
> service "kubia-http" exposed


**Important:** We’re using the abbreviation `rc` instead of `replicationcontroller`. Most resource types have an abbreviation like this so you don’t have to type the full name (for example, `po` for `pods`, `svc` for `services`, and so on).

#### Listing Services

The expose command’s output mentions a service called `kubia-http`. Services are objects like Pods and Nodes, so you can see the newly created Service object by running the **kubectl get services | svc** command, as shown in the following listing.

`kubectl get svc`

```bash
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1     <none>        443/TCP          7d
kubia-http   LoadBalancer   10.96.99.92   <pending>     8080:30126/TCP   7d
```

**Important** :- Minikube doesn’t support LoadBalancer services, so the service will never get an external IP. But you can access the service anyway through its external port. So external IP will always be pending in that case. When using Minikube, you can get the IP and port through which you
can access the service by running 

`minikube service kubia-http`

### Horizontally scaling the application

You now have a running application, monitored and kept running by a Replication-Controller and exposed to the world through a service. Now let’s make additional magic happen.
One of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the simplicity with which you can scale your deployments. Let’s see how easy it is to scale up the number of pods. You’ll increase the number of running instances to three.

Your pod is managed by a ReplicationController. Let’s see it with the kubectl get command:

`kubectl get rc`

```bash
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
kubia     1         1         1         7d
```

#### Increasing the desired Replica count

To scale up the number of replicas of your pod, you need to change the desired replica count on the ReplicationController like this:

`kubectl scale rc kubia --replicas=3`
> replicationcontroller "kubia" scaled

You’ve now told Kubernetes to make sure three instances of your pod are always running. Notice that you didn’t instruct Kubernetes what action to take. You didn’t tell it to add two more pods. You only set the new desired number of instances and let Kubernetes determine what actions it needs to take to achieve the requested state.

#### Seeing the result of the Scale Out

Back to your replica count increase. Let’s list the ReplicationControllers again to see the updated replica count:

`kubectl get rc`

```bash
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
kubia     3         3         3         7d
```

Because the actual number of pods has already been increased to three (as evident from the CURRENT column), listing all the pods should now show three pods instead of one:

`kubectl get pods`

```bash
NAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubia-5k788   1/1       Running   1          7d
kubia-7zxwj   1/1       Running   1          3d
kubia-bsksp   1/1       Running   1          3d
```

As you can see, three pods exist instead of one. Currently running, but if it is pending, it would be ready in a few moments, as soon as the container image is downloaded and the container is started.

As you can see, scaling an application is incredibly simple. Once your app is running in production and a need to scale the app arises, you can add additional instances with a single command without having to install and run additional copies manually.

Keep in mind that the app itself needs to support being scaled horizontally. Kubernetes doesn’t magically make your app scalable; it only makes it trivial to scale the app up or down.

#### Displaying the Pod IP and Pods Node when listing Pods

If you’ve been paying close attention, you probably noticed that the **kubectl get pods** command doesn’t even show any information about the nodes the pods are scheduled to. This is because it’s usually not an important piece of information.

But you can request additional columns to display using the **-o wide** option. When listing pods, this option shows the pod’s IP and the node the pod is running on:

`kubectl get pods -o wide`

```bash
NAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE
kubia-5k788   1/1       Running   1          7d        172.17.0.4   minikube
kubia-7zxwj   1/1       Running   1          3d        172.17.0.5   minikube
kubia-bsksp   1/1       Running   1          3d        172.17.0.6   minikube
```

#### Accessing Dashboard when using Minikube

To open the dashboard in your browser when using Minikube to run your Kubernetes cluster, run the following command:

`minikube dashboard`

### Pods

Pods and other Kubernetes resources are usually created by posting a JSON or YAML manifest to the Kubernetes REST API endpoint. Also, you can use other, simpler ways of creating resources, such as the **kubectl run** command, but they usually only allow you to configure a limited set of properties, not all. Additionally, defining all your Kubernetes objects from YAML files makes it possible to store them in a version control system, with all the benefits it brings.

#### Examining a YAML descriptor of an existing pod

 You’ll use the **kubectl get** command with the **-o yaml** option to get the whole YAML definition of the pod, or you can use **-o json** to get the whole JSON definition as shown in the following listing.

`kubectl get po kubia-bsksp -o yaml`

#### Introducing the main parts of a POD definition

The pod definition consists of a few parts. First, there’s the Kubernetes API version used in the YAML and the type of resource the YAML is describing. Then, three important sections are found in almost all Kubernetes resources:

- **Metadata** includes the name, namespace, labels, and other information about the pod.
- **Spec** contains the actual description of the pod’s contents, such as the pod’s containers, volumes, and other data.
- **Status** contains the current information about the running pod, such as what condition the pod is in, the description and status of each container, and the pod’s internal IP and other basic info.

The status part contains read-only runtime data that shows the state of the resource at a given moment. When creating a new pod, you never need to provide the status part.

The three parts described previously show the typical structure of a Kubernetes API object. All other objects have the same anatomy. This makes understanding new objects relatively easy.

Going through all the individual properties in the previous YAML doesn’t make much sense, so, instead, let’s see what the most basic YAML for creating a pod looks like.

#### Creating a simple YAML descriptor for a pod

You’re going to create a file called **kubia-manual.yaml** (you can create it in any directory you want), or copy from this repo, where you’ll find the file with filename [kubia-manual.yaml](https://github.com/knrt10/kubernetes-basicLearning/blob/master/kubia-manual.yaml). The following listing shows the entire contents of the file.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kubia-manual
spec:
  containers:
  - image: knrt10/kubia
    name: kubia
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
```

Let’s examine this descriptor in detail. It conforms to the **v1** version of the Kubernetes API. The type of resource you’re describing is a pod, with the name **kubia-manual**. The pod consists of a single container based on the **knrt10/kubia** image. You’ve also given a name to the container and indicated that it’s listening on port **8080**.

#### Using kubectl create to create the pod

To create the pod from your YAML file, use the **kubectl create** command:

`kubectl create -f kubia-manual.yaml`
> pod/kubia-manual created

The **kubectl create -f** command is used for creating any resource (not only pods) from a YAML or JSON file.

#### Retrieving a PODs logs with Kubectl logs

Your little Node.js application logs to the process’s standard output. Containerized applications usually log to the standard output and standard error stream instead of writing their logs to files. This is to allow users to view logs of different applications in a simple, standard way.

To see your pod’s log (more precisely, the container’s log) you run the following command on your local machine (no need to ssh anywhere):

`kubectl logs kubia-manual`
> Kubia server starting...

You haven’t sent any web requests to your Node.js app, so the log only shows a single log statement about the server starting up. As you can see, retrieving logs of an application running in Kubernetes is incredibly simple if the pod only contains a single container.

##### Specifying the container name when getting logs of multiple container pod 

If your pod includes multiple containers, you have to explicitly specify the container name by including the **-c container name** option when running **kubectl logs**. In your kubia-manual pod, you set the container’s name to **kubia**, so if additional containers exist in the pod, you’d have to get its logs like this:

`kubectl logs kubia-manual -c kubia`

Note that you can only retrieve container logs of pods that are still in existence. When a pod is deleted, its logs are also deleted.

#### Forwarding a Local Network to a port in the Pod

When you want to talk to a specific pod without going through a service (for debugging or other reasons), Kubernetes allows you to configure port forwarding to the pod. This is done through the **kubectl port-forward** command. The following command will forward your machine’s local port **8888** to port **8080** of your **kubia-manual** pod:

`kubectl port-forward kubia-manual 8888:8080`

In a different terminal, you can now use curl to send an HTTP request to your pod through the kubectl port-forward proxy running on localhost:8888:

`curl localhost:8888`
> You've hit kubia-manual

Using port forwarding like this is an effective way to test an individual pod.

### Introducing labels

Organizing pods and all other Kubernetes objects is done through labels. Labels are a simple, yet incredibly powerful, Kubernetes feature for organizing not only pods, but all other Kubernetes resources. A label is an arbitrary key-value pair you attach to a resource, which is then utilized when selecting resources using label selectors (resources are filtered based on whether they include the label specified in the selector). 

#### Specifying labels when creating a pod

Now, you’ll see labels in action by creating a new pod with two labels. Create a new file called **kubia-manual-with-labels.yaml** with the contents of the following listing. You can also copy from [kubia-manual-with-labels.yaml](https://github.com/knrt10/kubernetes-basicLearning/blob/master/kubia-manual-with-labels.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kubia-manual-v2
  labels:
    creation_method: manual
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: knrt10/kubia
    name: kubia
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
```

You’ve included the labels *creation_method=manual* and *env=data.labels* section. You’ll create this pod now:

`kubectl create -f kubia-manual-with-labels.yaml`

The **kubectl get po** command doesn’t list any labels by default, but you can see them by using the **--show-labels** switch:

`kubectl get po --show-labels`

```bash
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS
kubia-5k788       1/1       Running   1          8d        run=kubia
kubia-7zxwj       1/1       Running   1          5d        run=kubia
kubia-bsksp       1/1       Running   1          5d        run=kubia
kubia-manual      1/1       Running   0          7h        <none>
kubia-manual-v2   1/1       Running   0          3m        creation_method=manual,env=prod
```

Instead of listing all labels, if you’re only interested in certain labels, you can specify them with the **-L** switch and have each displayed in its own column. List pods again and show the columns for the two labels you’ve attached to your **kubia-manual-v2** pod:

`kubectl get po -L creation_method,env`

#### Modifying labels of existing pods

Labels can also be added to and modified on existing pods. Because the **kubia-manual** pod was also created manually, let’s add the **creation_method=manual** label to it:

`kubectl label po kubia-manual creation_method=manual`

Now, let’s also change the **env=prod** label to **env=debug** on the **kubia-manual-v2** pod, to see how existing labels can be changed. You need to use the **--overwrite** option when changing existing labels.

`kubectl label po kubia-manual-v2 env=debug --overwrite`

### Listing subsets of pods through label selectors

Attaching labels to resources so you can see the labels next to each resource when listing them isn’t that interesting. But labels go hand in hand with *label selectors*. Label selectors allow you to select a subset of pods tagged with certain labels and perform an operation on those pods.

A label selector can select resources based on whether the resource
- Contains (or doesn’t contain) a label with a certain key
- Contains a label with a certain key and value
- Contains a label with a certain key, but with a value not equal to the one you specify

#### Listing pods using a label selector

Let’s use label selectors on the pods you’ve created so far. To see all pods you created manually (you labeled them with **creation_method=manual**), do the following:

`kubectl get po -l creation_method=manual`
```bash
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubia-manual      1/1       Running   0          22h
kubia-manual-v2   1/1       Running   0          14h
```

And those that don’t have the **env** label:

`kubectl get po -l '!env'`
```bash
NAME           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubia-5k788    1/1       Running   1          9d
kubia-7zxwj    1/1       Running   1          5d
kubia-bsksp    1/1       Running   1          5d
kubia-manual   1/1       Running   0          22h
```

Make sure to use single quotes around **!env**, so the bash shell doesn’t
evaluate the exclamation mark

#### Using multiple conditions in a label selector

A selector can also include multiple comma-separated criteria. Resources need to match all of them to match the selector. You can execute command given below

`kubectl get po -l '!env , !creation_method' --show-labels`

### Using labels and selectors to constrain pod scheduling

All the pods you’ve created so far have been scheduled pretty much randomly across your worker nodes. Certain cases exist, however, where you’ll want to have at least a little say in where a pod should be scheduled. A good example is when your hardware infrastructure isn’t homogenous. You never want to say specifically what node a pod should be scheduled to, because that would couple the application to the infrastructure, whereas the whole idea of Kubernetes is hiding the actual infrastructure from the apps that run on it.

#### Using labels for categorizing worker nodes

The pods aren't only kubernetes resource type that you can attach label to. Labels can be attached to any Kubernetes resource including nodes.

Let’s imagine one of the nodes in your cluster contains a GPU meant to be used for general-purpose GPU computing. You want to add a label to the node showing this feature. You’re going to add the label **gpu=true** to one of your nodes (pick one out of the list returned by **kubectl get nodes**):

`kubectl label node minikube gpu=true`
> node/minikube labeled

Now you can use a label selector when listing the nodes, like you did before with pods. List only nodes that include the label *gpu=true*:

`kubectl get node -l gpu=true`

```bash
NAME       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
minikube   Ready     master    9d        v1.10.0
```

As expected, only one node has this label. You can also try listing all the nodes and tell kubectl to display an additional column showing the values of each node’s gpu label.

`kubectl get nodes -L gpu`
```bash
NAME       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION   GPU
minikube   Ready     master    9d        v1.10.0   true
```

#### Scheduling pods to specific nodes

Now imagine you want to deploy a new pod that needs a GPU to perform its work. To ask the scheduler to only choose among the nodes that provide a GPU, you’ll add a node selector to the pod’s YAML. Create a file called **kubia-gpu.yaml** with the following listing’s contents and then use **kubectl create -f kubia-gpu.yaml** to create the pod. The contents of file are

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kubia-gpu
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    gpu: "true"
  containers:
  - image: luksa/kubia
    name: kubia
```

You’ve added a **nodeSelector** field under the spec section. When you create the pod, the scheduler will only choose among the nodes that contain the *gpu=true* label (which is only a single node in your case).

#### Scheduling to one specific node

Similarly, you could also schedule a pod to an exact node, because each node also has a unique label with the key **kubernetes.io/hostname** and value set to the actual hostname of the node. Example shown below

`kubectl get nodes --show-labels`
```bash
NAME       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION   LABELS
minikube   Ready     master    9d        v1.10.0   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,gpu=true,kubernetes.io/hostname=minikube,node-role.kubernetes.io/master=
```
But setting the *nodeSelector* to a specific node by the hostname label may lead to the pod being unschedulable if the node is offline.
